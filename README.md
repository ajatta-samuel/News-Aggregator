# News-Aggregator
This Django project is a Python-powered news aggregator that gathers and analyzes technology news from the New York Times. It uses **Beautiful Soup** and **requests** to scrape articles from the website and **Newspaper3k** to store important metadata such as titles, authors, and publication dates. For deeper insights, a **natural language processing (NLP)** script built with **TextBlob** is employed to analyze each articleâ€™s sentiment. It measures both the **subjectivity** (how opinion-based or factual the content is) and **polarity** (the positive or negative tone of the article), giving users a better understanding of the emotional tone and bias within the news. This combination of scraping, storage, and sentiment analysis helps users quickly gauge the sentiment and key data of technology news.
